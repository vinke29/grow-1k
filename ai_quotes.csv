ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,Sebastien Naji,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.3,"And maybe just longer-term, do you think that generative AI could help improve that visibility from where it's historically been just given that many of these hyperscalers have what seems like decent visibility into a pretty robust pipeline over the next few years?"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"However, for AI, the timeline is longer since it's still in the early stages and requires more joint development."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"When do we start to see the materializing deployments of 800 gig and maybe that's tied to AI, maybe it's not, but just curious of when that cycle you believe really starts to kick in?"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,Anshul Sadana,COO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"51T and 800 gig especially are being pulled by AI clusters; the AI teams are very anxious to get their hands on it, move the data as quickly as possible, and reduce the job completion times."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,David Vogt,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.2,But trying to kind of walk the bridge to get from where we are today to '25 where you're going to start to see more widespread AI deployments from a revenue recognition perspective.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,George Notter,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,I guess I wanted to ask about your comments about 2025 participation in AI.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2023Q2,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",No,0.5,"So, I think you can look at 2023 as really a year of planning for AI, because as I said, there's tons and tons of GPUs being purchased."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Rudolph Araujo,Head of Investor Advocacy,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.1,"Our total addressable market and strategy for addressing these market opportunities, including AI, customer demand trends, supply chain constraints, component costs, manufacturing output, inventory management and inflationary pressures on our business, lead times, product innovation, working capital"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.9,"With the momentum of generative AI, we have achieved well beyond that at almost 20% growth, achieving record revenue of $7 billion coupled with a non-GAAP operating margin of 47.5%."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.8,"As mentioned in prior quarters, this expected activity represents purchases for chips related to new products and AI deployments."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Michael Ng,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.1,I was just wondering if you could talk about the timing of how the year might look like and how you expect the risk to switches in the AI back end we rolled out into production.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.7,"First, I want to emphasize that Arista remains focused on four of our five AI initiatives that I mentioned in previous calls."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Amit Daryanani,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"But can you maybe share your perspective that when it comes to AI network especially the back-end networks, how do you see the mix evolving white box versus OEM solution?"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.8,"In the backend of an AI cluster, there are generally two main components: the AI Leaf, which connects to the GPUs and serves as the initial point of connection, and the AI Spine, which aggregates these AI Leaves."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.6,"Specific to the others we added in, they're not 10% customers, but they're doing very well, and we are happy with their cloud and AI use cases."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",No,0.6,"Well, DeepSeek certainly deep-fix many stocks, but I actually see this as a positive because I think you're not going to see a new class of CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators and where you can have substantial efficiency gains that go beyond training."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.3,And then do you have any thoughts on just the broader context of what you're seeing on Sovereign AI opportunities in your business?
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,Stargate and Sovereign AI are not particularly related.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Atif Malik,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.1,"You are still forecasting $750 million in AI back-end sales this year, even with the delay of the fifth customer."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.2,"So I'll take your second question first, Atif, on the $70 billion TAM in 2028, I would roughly say a third is AI, a third is data center and cloud, and a third is campus and enterprise."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.7,"As we raised our guidance to $8.2 billion, I believe we'll see momentum in AI, cloud, and enterprises."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,And I have yet to see an AI spine deployment that is not EOS based.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.7,"Our classic cloud business, our AI and the enterprise, led by Ashwin and Chris is a very significant area of investment for us."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Tal Liani,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.2,Or do you start to see entries investing because of AI and applications for AI?
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.6,"From an AI perspective, conversations with customers are shifting from theoretical discussions to specific use cases, particularly among banks and major Global 2000 and Fortune 500 companies."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Antoine Chkaiban,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,I'd love to get your latest perspective on what you're hearing from service providers in One of your competitors mentioned that they were seeing AI driving demand for service providers because they're building out their network in anticipation of an increase in traffic driven by AI.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.3,We are witnessing the emergence of a new group of Tier 2 specialty cloud providers that aim to offer AI as a service with distinct features.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,The state transitions due to AI are definitely accelerating.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2024Q4,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,Yes,0.7,"As we move forward, we see not only that we connect to them that we can connect to AMD GPUs and build an in-house AI accelerators."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Rudolph Araujo,Head of Investor Advocacy,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.0,"During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the second quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, longer-term business model and financial outlook for 2025 and beyond our total addressable mar"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.8,"We had a strong start in Q1 2025, benefiting from the momentum of generative AI, data center cloud, and campus enterprises, achieving our first $2 billion quarter, just 11 quarters after our first billion-dollar quarter."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.7,"As Jayshree highlighted, there are opportunities across all three customer sectors, inclusive of Gen AI, data center, cloud and campus enterprises."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Rudolph Araujo,Head of Investor Advocacy,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.0,"Jayshree meant we were reiterating our back-end goal of $715 million, not front-end AI."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Amit Daryanani,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.0,"Jayshree, I think there's been a fair amount of noise and speculation intra-quarter on the 4, 5 back-end AI customers that you have and sort of the different things are exploring."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,Yes,0.7,"It is getting harder and harder to measure front end and back end, maybe we look at the full AI cluster differently next year."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.3,"There is significant interest in these products, but many are new to AI and unsure about designing a network for four or eight rails, how to connect to GPUs, and what NIC attachments are needed, as well as the necessary cables and optics."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"We're seeing it in AI, we're seeing it on campus enterprises."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.0,"Jayshree, could you provide an update on the four Tier 1 customers you're working with regarding the AI back end?"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.7,"And based on our execution of 2025, and plans we’re putting together, we should have a great year in 2026 as well for AI clusters typically."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.6,"You may remember, Karl, that I alluded to this earlier in 2024, the majority of our AI trials were on 400 gig at that time."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,Internal Automation,No,0.5,"However, for complex applications, such as AI spine roles that require mission-critical features, Arista plays a significantly larger role with our premium, scalable software and hardware integrations than with standalone white box solutions."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Antoine Chkaiban,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.0,And I was wondering whether that had any impact on your views regarding CPO adoption in back-end AI networks in coming years.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Meta Marshall,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.0,"I wanted to ask about the $750 million back-end target you reiterated, but I'm curious about the $1.5 billion AI target for 2025."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.6,"The $1.5 billion is an ambitious goal, but it's difficult to determine if it's from AI traffic or cloud traffic."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Sebastian Naji,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.0,"While there's a significant focus on AI demand, some major cloud players are experiencing strong growth in their non-AI segments."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"I don't know if you remember, again, two years ago, I was very nervous because the entire cloud titans pivoted to AI and slowed down their cloud."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,"So some of the best attributes come from our blue boxes, not only for 48 ports, but all the way up to 576 ports of an AI spine or double that if you are looking for dual capabilities."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.3,I cannot get an AI network.

ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",No,0.7,Some are definitely experimenting with other AI accelerators like Lisa and MD.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.9,"We, therefore, raised our 2025 annual growth to 25%, now targeting $8.75 billion in revenue, which is an incremental $550 million more due to our increased momentum that we are experiencing across AI, cloud, and enterprise sectors."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Todd Nightingale,President and COO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.8,"It's only been a month, but I can't tell you how impressed I am with the passion and focus of the team, the trust that Arista customers have in the technology and the enormous opportunity we have ahead of us in the data center, AI, and in the campus."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.4,"So to the question you were asking, our increased $550 million had a little bit of Velo, not material, as Chantelle reminds me, but a lot of cloud and AI as well as enterprise campus."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"So first, scale-up is a unique requirement, and it will particularly come in as people start building more AI racks."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.6,"On AI, despite losing one of our key anchor customers, we were still able to achieve and exceed measures."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"From the deferred balance between products and services, this is indicative of new product, new use case, AI, and is across those categories."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"Definitely, AI is going to create large investments that will translate into some investments into us as well."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.2,"As we think about the sovereign AI opportunity, how should we look at customer engagements?"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,We're cautiously optimistic about the sovereign AI segment.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jayshree V. Ullal,Chairperson and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,We are looking forward to continued innovation and believe our platform is capable of supporting both AI and WAN applications effectively.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Rudolph Araujo,Head of Investor Advocacy,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"During the course of this conference call, Arista Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including those relating to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, longer-term business model and financial outlook for 2026 and beyond, our total addressable ma"
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.8,"Our stated goal of $1.5 billion AI aggregate for 2025, comprising both back end and front end is well underway."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Kenneth Duda,President and Chief Technology Officer,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",No,0.9,"I would like to one of the best things about working at Arista is getting to build some of the most ambitious networks ever built, ultra-low latency trading networks, global scale cloud networks and most recently, multi-petabit AI networks."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.7,"You have always built the always-on resilient leaf-spine architecture, both now for networking for AI workloads, and AVA to bring AI to networking."

ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.8,"Revenue of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion with continued growth expected across our cloud, AI, enterprise and providers markets."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.3,"We do have a mix of product margin where it's significantly below 60% with our cloud and AI titans driving the volume and higher obviously, for the enterprise customers."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Atif Malik,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"Jayshree, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned large language model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and they have announced partnerships with your cloud titans."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"We intimately work with the software and LLM players because they certainly guide the design but we also work with the cloud titans, and it's a shared responsibility between both of them and where the responsibility for procuring the large data centers and the power and the location and the cooling "
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"The only other thing I'd add to this just generally is a topic is that when you think about that the large AI use cases are acceptance clauses, it really comes down to that coming together and the timing of that."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.0,"In AI, it's taking longer."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,David Vogt,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,-0.1,"Considering the outlook for 2026 that you recently raised, which we didn't anticipate would happen this early, I want to discuss your efforts related to the AI-centric opportunities, campus, and Velo."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chantelle Breithaupt,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.1,We have set specific goals for ourselves in relation to AI and our campus initiatives.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"And so yelling isn't the tone I'd like to attribute it to, excitement maybe, your enthusiasm is the one I'd like you to think about, which is clearly, AI and campus is going to grow and do great guns for us as it should because they are 2 very large TAMs."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Benjamin Reitzes,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,I think there was an earlier question around OpenAI and Anthropic and just some of these larger builds with the private companies that obviously are becoming hyperscalers.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.6,"Until now, majority of how we've measured our AI success through our cloud and AI titans has been number of GPUs and how much are they installing and can we verify that the Ethernet network works."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,These are critical AI workloads.

ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Kenneth Duda,President and Chief Technology Officer,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"It's incredibly mission-critical and supports a whole variety of applications, not just the straightforward if demanding communication patterns of the AI back end."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.5,"On one side, the AI and cloud makes us dizzy."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,John Jeffrey Hopson,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"We've seen a lot of the deals with the hyperscalers or the AI model companies with new data center build-outs, probably not a level since we've seen with the cloud build-out."
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,So these are newly constructed AI build-outs as opposed to the traditional CPU or storage-driven cloud build-outs.
ANET,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jayshree Ullal,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.3,"So we're working again on this dichotomy in our business and planning as much as we can for the AI, but also planning ahead as much as we can for the enterprise and campus."
AJG,Insurance Brokers,2024Q2,J. Patrick Gallagher,Chairman and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.5,"You can't take a book, there's no AI that says, Oh, an auto dealer has this much appetite for risk based on the number of cars in the lot."

AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Stacy Rasgon,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.2,"Like, how far out does that go and how much of that $110 billion is AI versus non-AI versus software?"
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.3,"And it's largely driven by AI, as we grow in terms of growth."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Stacy Rasgon,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"And it's fair to say that of that semiconductor piece, it's gonna be much more AI than non-AI?"
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Ben Reitzes,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.1,"Hock, congrats on able to guide to the AI revenue well above 60% for next year."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.3,"One is simply the guys, the parties, the customers, who develop their own LLM, and the rest of the other market I consider is collectively lumped as enterprise."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.4,"As the scale of these clusters and the bandwidth required for AI training expands, we now launched this Jericho four fifty one terabit per second to handle more bandwidth, but same technology we have tested and proven for the last ten, twenty years."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.3,"And that will sustain for quite a while because on top of that, we will start selling advanced services, security, disaster recovery, even AI running AI workloads on it."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Joe Moore,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.2,"In terms of the fourth customer, I think you've talked in the past about potential customers four and five were more hyperscale, and six and seven were more like, you know, the LLM makers themselves."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.2,"It's towards the end of the day, all seven do LLMs."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Joshua Buchhalter,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.2,And how meaningful do you think the scale-up Ethernet opportunity could be over the next year as we think about your AI networking business?
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q3,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.4,"And we ourselves are thinking about that too because, to begin with, our Ethernet solutions are very disaggregated from the AI's accelerators."

AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.5,Going into an AI accelerator of your own is a long-term strategic move and nothing would deter you from there to continue to make that investment towards that end goal of successfully creating and deploying your own custom AI accelerator.
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Harlan Sur,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.4,So you talked about total AI backlog of $73 billion over the next six quarters.
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,"We have so many components beyond XPUs, customer accelerators, in or any system, in AI system, any AI system, used by hyperscalers that, yeah, we believe it begins to make sense to do it as a system sales and be responsive but be fully responsible for the entire system or rack as you call it."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Stacy Rasgon,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,So I understand why the AI business is somewhat dilutive to gross margins.
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"The AI revenue has a lower gross margin than our obviously, the rest of the business, including software, of course."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Jim Schneider,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,Yes,0.5,"And then maybe if you could separately clarify whether your $1 billion of orders for the fifth customer is indeed OpenAI, which you made a separate announcement about."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,Yes,0.6,"We originally, six months ago said maybe year on year, AI revenues would grow in 2026 sixty, 70%."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Ben Reitzes,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"I wanted to ask I I'm not sure if the last caller said something on it, but I didn't hear it in the answer was wanted to ask about the OpenAI contract that it's supposed to start in the second half of the year and go through 2029 for 10 gigawatts."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"As far as the OpenAI view that you have, I we appreciate the fact that it is a multiyear journey."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Harsh Kumar,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.2,"The easy one is, your guide in AI Hock and Kirsten is calling for almost $1.7 billion of sequential growth."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.3,"Of the $73 billion or AI revenue backlog over the next eighteen months, I talked about maybe $20 billion of it is everything else."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Carl Ackerman,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,I guess what I can get at is you also happen to address the very large subset of networking and compute AI supply chains.
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.4,To create multiple key leading-edge components that enable today's state-of-the-art AI data centers.
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Christopher Rolland,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"And sorry to come back to this issue, but if I understand you correctly, Hock, I think you were saying that OpenAI would be a general agreement so it's not binding maybe similar to the agreements with both NVIDIA and AMD."
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Hock Tan,President and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.3,And it's more I think maybe the ops and AI is sucking the ops oxygen a lot out of enterprise spending elsewhere.
AVGO,Semiconductors,2025Q4,Ji Yoo,Head of Investor Relations,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"This quarter, Broadcom will be presenting at the New Street Research Virtual AI Big Ideas Conference on Monday, 12/15/2025."

CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"I think from a security perspective and a strategic security perspective, our large enterprise customers are incredibly optimistic about what Hypershield means for them, but from an AI application deployment perspective, our customers are very excited about what Hyperfabric will mean to them."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"So, on this AI opportunity and as we kind of focus on the backlog converting into revenue, I'm curious of how you see the AI back-end possibly leading into front-end opportunities."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,Enterprises are focusing on two main aspects: updating their infrastructure for AI and preparing for widespread deployment of AI applications.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Karl Ackerman,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"But I guess, are these product orders all four top of rack switches, or is the growth in AI networking hardware primarily driven by one hyperscaler today, which now appears to be across silicon and switches?"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Scott Herren,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"It was more about finding efficiencies across the company and turning around and reinvesting those in the fastest growing parts of our business, namely AI and security, and you see some of the great results coming out of that."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.6,And I would say that it was not just one customer on the AI infrastructure front; it was pretty balanced across all of them.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q1,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.8,"I think that as we talk about this whole AI transformation that's happening, I think, again, there are three big areas that we're focused on."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,1.0,"Importantly, our AI infrastructure orders with webscalers in Q2 surpassed $350 million, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $700 million, and we are on track to exceed $1 billion of AI infrastructure orders in fiscal year '25."

CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, AI Infrastructure",No,0.8,"On your second question, we absolutely believe that a lot of this demand is being driven by customers preparing for AI."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Matthew Niknam,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.5,You talk about enterprises investing a little bit more in AI.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,"So I would say what we're seeing on the enterprise side relative to AI is, it's still - customers are still in the very early days, and they all realize they need to figure out exactly what their use cases are."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,Analyst,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.0,"And for my follow-up, I think it's more about hyperscaler and the AI momentum you're seeing there."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.8,"If you look at AI defense with the AI Summit that we did recently, I think there's about 20 some odd customers who are interested in going to proof of concept with us right now on it."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Amit Daryanani,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.0,Just a quick question on the 700 million AI orders so far this year.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.7,"On the $700 million in AI orders, it's a combination of systems, silicon, optics and optical systems."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Jim Fish,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.0,"And then secondly, to the last question, what are you guys seeing from where you're winning within the data center between the Silicon One approach versus sort of systems approach with your AI wins?"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,0.5,"On these other deals, I mean, if you look at technology like DeepSeek, we think not DeepSeek in particular, but we think as see more of this democratization of the access that is going to just facilitate a faster advancement of AI applications in the enterprise, first of all."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Antoine Chkaiban,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.0,So I'd like to follow up on the question regarding traction from enterprise customers in AI.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.4,"Now we believe with the Nvidia partnership, the hyper fabric stack, the AI pods, the things that we're building, we think that as we integrate that stack together and they have these reference architectures to build that we think that, that will lead to our networking equipment being combined with N"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,0.0,As you think about that 50% of your business on the AI orders being tied to switch and Silicon One silicon.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Karl Ackerman,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.0,"Is the greater visibility and support of your April core outlook from enterprises and even telco operators, coming from just a return to normal order patterns or lead times extending out beyond a quarter across those customers as you begin to introduce AI pods and Hybridshield and perhaps some on-pr"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Scott Herren,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.7,"And what we hear from telco, particularly in international, is they are in anticipation of demand on their networks driven by AI, doing the same thing that we hear enterprise is doing."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.7,And I think the other thing that we see some of the European operators are looking at delivering AI as a service.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q2,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.8,"Clearly, the AI tailwind as well as the integration that has occurred so far relative to Splunk and just the team's period execution."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.8,"In addition, we received AI infrastructure orders from web-scale customers in excess of $600 million in Q3, bringing our year-to-date total to well over $1 billion, surpassing our original fiscal year '25 AI order target a full quarter early."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"The AI transition is crucial, and I believe they will continue to invest until it becomes absolutely necessary to halt spending."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Scott Herren,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"And Tal, just to remind you, as we continue to build out all the public cloud infrastructure for training, there is a significantly larger opportunity in enterprise AI as companies develop the capability to perform inferencing within their own data centers."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.6,"The general belief and feedback that we're getting from these customers is as they get ready to roll out a genetic AI, in particular, the network is absolutely going to be key because of the real-time nature of this communication, and they all want to ensure that while they may not know exactly what"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Amit Daryanani,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.3,"Starting off your AI orders at $1 billion, it came in, I think, a quarter ahead of what you had expected, and it looks like you're seeing some continued momentum as you go forward with sovereign and enterprise that you talked about."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"Regarding AI orders, it's important to remember that these are large customers and the orders are non-linear."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.6,"You'll see us focusing on integrating AI and security services within the network so that our customers can implement this seamlessly, which is essential for addressing AI challenges."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Jim Fish,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.3,"If AI really isn't substitutionary of existing non-AI networking real estate with some of these web scales and enterprise is growing at the rates you're calling out, why isn't this sort of growing faster than even the 8% on the comp here?"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,"On the first one, I think the short answer is that most of this AI infrastructure has not begun to flow through revenue yet."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Andrew Spinola,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.2,I wanted to ask about the nature of the $600 million in AI orders.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Karl Ackerman,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.2,I was hoping you could quantify your AI orders for the enterprise at our incremental to the $1 billion of order target you have for cloud.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"The AI orders in the enterprise space have been somewhat challenging for us to identify, but we've been working on establishing a baseline."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Adrienne Colby,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,It's been a while since you talked about your AI pipeline versus your AI orders.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.4,"Yes, we currently do not provide details on our AI pipeline."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Sebastien Naji,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,And is it AI that's driving that share shift or something else that's happening?
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q3,Chuck Robbins,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.8,"As we look ahead, we see a strong opportunity in AI and believe we are well positioned."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.7,"According to our survey of IT networking leaders, 97% of businesses believe they need to upgrade their networks to successfully deploy AI."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Aaron Christopher Rakers,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,-0.2,"My first question is regarding your guidance, particularly in light of the AI opportunity and the impact of sovereign initiatives starting in the second half of the fiscal year."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.3,I want to emphasize that we are satisfied with our performance in the AI space.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.4,"Previously, I mentioned that we have two categories of products: the new and refreshed ones, which include SASE, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense, and our updated firewall portfolio, and the older products that aren't significant investment areas for us at the moment, representing the long tail of the p"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Mark Patterson,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"And I think as I look ahead, we have significant opportunity, whether it's in AI infrastructure, in the webscale space, now in the nascent but growing enterprise AI opportunity."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Simon Matthew Leopold,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,-0.1,"And then as my follow-up, I'm wondering if you could talk about your expectations over the longer term for the composition of the AI business."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"Regarding your second question about the AI business composition, particularly in the back-end networks of cloud providers, I don't believe there's any indication of a significant shift based on our discussions with them."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.7,"If we take a step back, we can identify two key factors at play: the AI revolution and the refresh opportunity."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Michael Ng,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.0,"First, regarding AI, could you explain the over $2 billion in AI orders this year?"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.5,"Regarding AI infrastructure, we received over $800 million in orders for the quarter, totaling more than $2 billion for the year, which is more than double our original target."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Mark Patterson,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.5,"In terms of revenue and shipments related to those AI orders, those really just progressed and ramped like we expected during FY '25."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.5,So we recognized roughly $1 billion of revenue on the AI back-end orders that we've taken from the webscale customers during fiscal year '25.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,0.1,"And then my follow-up, maybe just continuing on to the prior answer for Chuck, how much revenue contribution are you embedding in fiscal '26 from AI given the $2 billion order that you had this year?"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",Yes,0.3,"On the enterprise side, we observed a significant number of orders, primarily related to networking and AI GPU technologies."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.5,So I don't feel like AI is a fleeting trend.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Benjamin Alexander Reitzes,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,Yes,-0.2,"But security, I mean, your execution in switching and the AI stuff is obviously better than expected, but the security was pretty well below the street, and it has to accelerate pretty significantly to get to your 15% to 17% growth for security plus observability long-term target."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Benjamin Alexander Reitzes,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"I'm interested in how much you are focusing on partnerships outside of NVIDIA in the AI space, and whether that's something you can pursue as well."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.4,"The new and refreshed products I discussed include Secure Access, XDR, Hypershield, AI Defense, new firewalls, and identity solutions, which are particularly significant right now."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,James Edward Fish,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"And how are you thinking about that identity and privileged access space, given you're going to have more AI to AI or machine-to-machine interactions occurring in the future?"
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,David Vogt,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.1,"But if I think about your order intake as being averaging at least kind of roughly 50% on average for SP, and if I use that as a proxy in fiscal '26, it looks like AI could add about 2 points of revenue growth to sort of the networking business in '26."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Adrienne Eleanor Colby,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.1,And I also wanted to just circle back on the sovereign AI opportunities about your expectations in terms of order flow and revenue recognition there.
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Sebastien Cyrus Naji,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.3,"My first question is on the back-end AI network opportunity, but maybe a little bit more longer term."
CSCO,Communications Equipment,2025Q4,Charles H. Robbins,Chair and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.6,"Artificial intelligence is undeniably a significant advantage for us, along with the momentum in webscale, the growth of the enterprise, sovereign opportunities, and Neocloud."

DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,Yes,0.2,"Olivier, we noticed your AI contributions surged to about 6% this quarter."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.3,So there are a few others both on AI lines and other kinds of models.
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Sanjit Singh,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"Is that still the theme in terms of driving new bookings, new expansion deals, or are you starting to see customers focused less on the consolidation opportunity, more on innovation and bringing their innovation budgets to bear to invest in AI and cloud, bringing Datadog along for the ride?"
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"At the same time, we're excited to see what's happening with AI innovation as it transitions from testing and experimenting into real production applications."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Raimo Lenschow,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.3,"How much of this is purely macroeconomic and how much involves reallocating project resources—not just funds but also time—toward AI, considering we are still in the early stages of this lifecycle?"
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.4,"Where the workload might have grown more, instead of 20%, they could grow 25%, perhaps some of those 5% are going into AI, which is largely right now in experimentation and model training."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Karl Keirstead,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.1,I have a couple of questions regarding your comment about some of your larger AI native customers.
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.3,"Look, what we see is that we have a small number of AI-native companies, many of which are model providers or infrastructure providers for AI that serve the rest of the industry."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Mike Cikos,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.4,"The first on gross margin: can you speak to anything relating to those AI-native customers, the intensity of those workloads?"
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,"We observe classical workloads in the cloud, with very large growth on the AI-native side."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q3,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"Firstly, to the product management team for building great products last quarter, to the customers that spent their time with us to ensure those products work right, especially for the new products like LLM observability and On Call."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.7,"During 2024, we kept building and innovating as we scaled up our teams and went broader and deeper into the problems we solve for our customers from the cloud to AI."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,David Obstler,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.6,"Next, we continue to see robust contribution from AI native customers who represented about 6% of Q4 ARR, roughly the same as last quarter and up from about 3% of ARR in the year-ago quarter."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,I'm curious how you're feeling overall about the book of business for AI native customers.
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"In the AI cohort, we observed renewals with increased commitments, improved terms, and optimized usage, which is typical for larger end customers during renewals as they aim to maximize their value."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.2,And they were talking about capacity constraints on the AI side.
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,It's challenging to determine precisely what is happening regarding the AI capacity constraints.
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Raimo Lenschow,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.4,"There's a lot of focus on the major AI players right now, but that's just the beginning of the AI opportunity."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.5,"Currently, we provide this through our LLM observability, which has seen significant adoption, largely not from AI-native companies."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Matthew Hedberg,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"Also, regarding the digital and AI aspects mentioned earlier, does your guidance anticipate a consistent contribution throughout the year?"
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,David Obstler,CFO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.4,"When considering the contribution from AI, we incorporate that into our discount level."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Eric Heath,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"And Oli, I'd love to just get some of your thoughts on Agentic AI and AI generally."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,Internal Automation,No,0.6,"However, we have noticed that when we began developing our LLM Observability product, most customer use cases were centered around chatbots or RAG, where the aim was to access and return information."
DDOG,Application Software,2024Q4,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,Internal Automation,No,0.5,"Inside Datadog, what’s intriguing about the current evolution of AI is that it impacts various aspects of our business."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.9,"At the end of Q1, more than 4,000 customers used one or more Datadog AI integrations, and this number has doubled year-over-year."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,David Obstler,CFO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.7,"We saw a continued rise in contribution from AI native customers who represented about 8.5% of Q1 ARR, up from about 6% of ARR last quarter and up from about 3.5% of ARR in the year-ago quarter."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,0.4,"Olivier, we noticed the CEO of Anthropic recently said that within 12 to 18 months that AI is going to be writing 100% of all code."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.8,We see the rise of AI-written code.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.5,The combination of those large AI numbers is incredible.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,"It's not really trending up, not trending down right now, but we see the same desire from customers to move more into the cloud and to lay the groundwork so they can also adopt AI because digital transformation and cloud migrations are prerequisites for that."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.9,"However, we now realize that this field is evolving into a significant enabler for building AI workloads, or conversely, a hindrance if not approached correctly."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Kash Rangan,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.4,"Oli, when you look at the AI market, certainly, it looks like we're about to move from training into inference."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q1,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.7,We have created an LLM observability product that is seeing increasing adoption from customers as they transition to production.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.9,"They include more than a dozen that are spending over $1 million a year with us and more than 80 who are spending more than $100,000, and they include 8 of the top 10 leading AI companies."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,David M. Obstler,CFO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.7,"We saw a continued rise in contribution from AI native customers in the quarter who represented about 11% of Q2 revenues, up from 8% of revenues in the last quarter and about 4% of revenues in the year-ago quarter."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Raimo Lenschow,Analyst,Analyst,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",No,0.2,"Olivier, like you talked about the AI contribution and slowly broadening out."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.8,"On the AI opportunity, so there's really multiple layers to it."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Sanjit Kumar Singh,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"Considering your comments about the AI native cohort potentially facing volatility, I’m trying to reconcile that with such strong guidance."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,David M. Obstler,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,We provided metrics showing that the AI cohort is growing rapidly and we are gaining significant market share in that area.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,David M. Obstler,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.3,This is not a comment about AI.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Mark Ronald Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"It looks like you're bringing very serious AI research to a space where it is applicable and opening it up very broadly, the size of the dataset is vast."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,Internal Automation,No,0.7,We believe there is significant potential in automation through autonomous AI agents.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.5,"The one thing I would add, which is that we also are spending more on AI training and inference in R&D if you compare to past years in R&D, and the output of that is things such as Toto or the next versions of it that we're training right now and experiments we're running to train agents, run simula"
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Koji Ikeda,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"How are you feeling about contract visibility, specifically with your large AI native customers?"
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.7,"This sector requires us to address essential foundational features while also investing in future innovations, particularly as AI is transforming the landscape."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Karl Emil Keirstead,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.3,"So David, now that the AI natives are 11% of Datadog's revenue mix, I think it's fair to ask whether the revenues from that cohort are coming at similar margins as the rest of the business?"
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,David M. Obstler,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"I would say like we talked about last quarter, this isn't about the AI and margins, the AI cohort versus non-AI cohorts."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Michael Joseph Cikos,Analyst,Analyst,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.4,Is it reasonable to compare traditional enterprises using CPUs with AI-focused companies that are increasing their investments in GPUs?
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,"Today, however, AI-native companies and enterprises are distinct entities."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Jacob Roberge,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,There's obviously been a lot of talk about AI natives around the business.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Jacob Roberge,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"That's helpful, and then could you also talk about the uptake and feedback that you're getting for your own AI solutions like Bits AI, the new observability agents?"
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,So I mean the initial response to the AI agents is really pretty positive.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q2,Olivier Pomel,Co-Founder and CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",No,0.5,"We're consuming more AI training inference, which is changing the balance between human tasks and those handled by GPUs."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.9,"As an illustration of growth and adoption in the past few months, the number of LLM span customers sending to Datadog has more than quadrupled."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,David Obstler,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.7,"In addition, we now have more larger AI customers, including 15 of them spending $1 million or more annually with Datadog and about 100 spending more than $100,000 annually."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Sanjit Singh,Analyst,Analyst,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",No,0.3,Is there sort of an uplift in sort of the cloud migration trends as you're starting to see enterprises build more AI applications?
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Sanjit Singh,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.3,And just as a follow-up on the AI observability opportunity.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"Additionally, we feel that AI capabilities cannot be separated from non-AI components of the business."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Raimo Lenschow,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"On the AI front, without focusing on any particular customer, the fact that there are 15 customers contributing over a million is significant, and over 100 with contributions exceeding 100,000 is impressive."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",No,0.6,They may not have started as AI-focused but have quickly adapted to growth in the AI sector.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"You had mentioned the expansion of the contract with your largest AI native customer, and I believe you said better economics for a higher commitment."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Fatima Boolani,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,So how do you just broader advancements in AI help beef up and/or detract your ability to monetize this product?
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.8,"We believed that with AI, particularly, we could achieve capabilities throughout the whole cycle that wouldn’t be possible otherwise."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Eric Heath,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.5,"Oli, David, Bits AI seems like a really exciting thing out of Dash."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.8,"Regarding the impact for next year, I'm uncertain whether the significant effect will stem from our pricing of Bits AI itself or from the benefits it brings to the broader platform."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.6,The biggest surprise has been that AI adoption has grown more rapidly than we anticipated at the start of the year.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,David Obstler,CFO,Executive,AI-Enhanced Feature,No,0.5,"When we examine the situation, it's not solely an AI-driven phenomenon."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Aleksandr Zukin,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.3,"And then maybe, David, for you, look, gross profit dollar acceleration while you're seeing your largest customer get better unit economics is also inspiring to see how should we think about the progression of gross margins and gross profit dollar growth, particularly as you continue to also see the "
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Ryan MacWilliams,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"On the large AI contract expansion that you provided commentary on, is there any way we can think about the contribution change from this customer over the next few quarters?"
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,David Obstler,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"And when we look at it, it's not just an AI SMB."
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Karl Keirstead,Analyst,Analyst,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.2,Some of the very large AI natives are beginning to diversify to utilizing Oracle's OCI and Stargate.
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Jacob Roberge,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"And then just on the new Bits AI Agents, can you just talk about the early feedback that you've gotten for those solutions and maybe how the engagement with those agents compares to kind of the ramp of security Flex Logs?"
DDOG,Application Software,2025Q3,Olivier Pomel,CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.8,The Bits AI Agent has a significant growth potential for our customers.
DECK,Footwear,2024Q2,Dave Powers,President and CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.7,"We have some work to do there, but we want to be providing our teams with the right level of visibility so they can run their businesses effectively and leverage AI technologies coming down the pike and then continue to heavily invest in marketing."

IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Toni Sacconaghi,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,-0.1,"And part of the reason I ask the question is, if it looks like your AI book of business was up about $1 billion sequentially."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Arvind Krishna,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.2,"When you do have that pressure, but there is a demand for AI, I would suggest that probably the bulk of that demand, not all, but the bulk is indeed a shift from other areas of Consulting."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Jim Kavanaugh,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.3,"First of all, we're very pleased with the early momentum that we've gotten with our book of business around GenAI, both on the technology side with our watsonx platform and now with our open innovation strategy around RHEL AI, OpenShift Granite models, InstructLab, etc."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Amit Daryanani,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,-0.2,"And when I think about this business growing low-single-digits for '24, if I take out some of the M&A contribution, also some of the revenues from the AI book of business that you have at $1.5 billion, is it fair to think that maybe the non-AI Consulting piece actually gets worse in H2 versus H1 for"
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Jim Kavanaugh,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.6,We had GenAI momentum that was going to continue throughout the year early in the cycle.
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Arvind Krishna,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"By focused, I mean we stick to the areas that we are investing in hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q2,Arvind Krishna,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.5,"And a vector that we have not talked about that will play, but probably into '25 and '26, we are very excited by our two open-source AI projects inside the Red Hat business, our RHEL AI as well as OpenShift AI."

IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q3,Arvind Krishna,"Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer",Executive,AI Infrastructure,Yes,0.4,"I believe the upcoming results might reflect a tale of two halves, with Consulting showing modest performance in the first half but improving significantly in the second half due to positive signs in signings, offerings, and the conversion of Gen AI business into actual revenue across our clients."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q3,Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.1,"But if we look at what happened with your AI book of business, which is up meaningfully a meaningful part of that being in services, it would indicate that the underlying Consulting business ex, that kind of deteriorated."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q3,James Kavanaugh,Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,Executive,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,0.5,"This growth includes about $1 billion in new business generated in the last two quarters, consisting of mid to long-term digital transformation deals in Gen AI."

IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q4,Jim Schneider,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,Yes,0.3,"And then secondly, on the AI Software side, you mentioned the $1 billion book of business purely within Software, that's pretty substantial."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q4,James Kavanaugh,Senior Vice President and CFO,Executive,Vague/Buzzword,Yes,0.5,"Now, why have we been so maniacally focused on the GenAI ramp and our greater than $4 billion book of business right now coming out six quarters in, which we believe, by the way, we're in a very early leadership position around that."
IBM,IT Consulting & Other Services,2024Q4,Arvind Krishna,"Chairman, President and CEO",Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.8,Our watsonx family encapsulates our primary products that incorporate LLMs and AI technology.

MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Amy Hood,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.7,"But specifically to your question on how does it show up, it's easiest in this situation to think about them as a customer of ours like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI services in service of supporting their end customers."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"The third is perhaps more of a relative statement because of some of the work we've done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations we never had, whether it's coming through you and just OpenAI's API, right?"
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Brent Thill,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,Yes,0.4,"And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through Copilot, say, 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the Suite or is it too hard to factor in?"
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.6,The Copilot that's priced and it is there is GitHub Copilot.
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Amy Hood,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",No,0.5,"And frankly, that’s what the Copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have this price for those, and you’ll be able to look at that as we get to release, and to Satya’s point, GitHub Copilot is a great example."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Raimo Lenschow,Analyst,Analyst,AI Infrastructure,No,0.4,Just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact of Azure.
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,"One is that accelerated computing is essential for driving AI, and we are highly focused on ensuring efficient resource usage."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Amy Hood,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.5,"It's that really even our first-party workloads and apps that are built, right, are built on the same platform, and we're able because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first-party as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first-party, we're able to take advantage o"
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Keith Bachman,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.3,"Could you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix and particularly supporting generative AI and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year?"
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Amy Hood,CFO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.6,"We will prioritize investment in AI, which I mentioned will drive up cost of goods sold, but we are dedicated to maintaining healthy profitability by controlling operating expenses."

MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, Risk/Regulatory",No,0.5,"So for example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles, we translated the AI principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process that then we hold ourselves to internal audit essentially."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"Regarding AI, it's important to note that an AI application involves more than just the AI model."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q3,Amy Hood,CFO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",No,0.6,"And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that's going to get done, whether that's the Dynamics workload that we've talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI "
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI-Enhanced Feature, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.9,"Nearly 90% of GitHub Copilot sign-ups are self-service, indicating strong organic interest and pull-through."

MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.8,"And then to your other question on how all this translates into project starts effectively, the Copilot stack is available today on Azure."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Kasthuri Rangan,Analyst,Analyst,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.6,"It looks like Azure growth rate is definitely starting to stabilize and generative AI contribution to Azure is measurably improving quarter-over-quarter, and optimization in a broader sense is also starting to settle down."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",Yes,0.7,"If we assume that tech spending increases from 5% of GDP to 10%, potentially accelerated by advancements in AI, we need to assess how that spending will distribute across our Commercial Cloud offerings and how competitive we are at each level."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Karl Keirstead,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.5,"Amy, if I could double-click a little bit on the exciting news around M365 Copilot as everybody on the line looks to layer that opportunity into our models, I just wanted to get your views."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Amy Hood,CFO,Executive,AI-Native Product,No,0.6,"It's crucial to maintain the right pace, and we still need to finalize the pricing and release of both Security Copilot and some Dynamics workloads."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,"AI-Native Product, AI Infrastructure",No,0.7,"If I could just add to what Amy said, the platform effect here is really all about the extensibility of the Copilots."
MSFT,Systems Software,2023Q4,Mark Murphy,Analyst,Analyst,"AI-Native Product, Internal Automation",Yes,0.6,"Satya, there's so much evidence now that GitHub Copilot is boosting developer productivity by 40% to 50% or more, and it's resulting in higher quality code."

MSFT,Systems Software,2025Q4,Amy E. Hood,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"Especially as the AI model capability grows, you'll end up with ways that teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job."
MSFT,Systems Software,2025Q4,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,AI Infrastructure,No,0.5,"This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud-native e-commerce company, let's say."
MSFT,Systems Software,2025Q4,Satya Nadella,CEO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"But I think what we are noticing in our own build-out of these AI applications and in general is the platform is becoming more than, 'Here is the model and here is an API."
MSFT,Systems Software,2025Q4,Raimo Lenschow,Analyst,Analyst,AI-Native Product,No,0.4,"I have a question regarding Copilot, and as a satisfied user at Barclays, I’ve noticed something."

NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Kash Rangan,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.5,"It looks like generative AI is making sales cycles easier, if I could say that, and has the potential to bring in repeat business with existing customers at a faster pace and magnitude."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,CJ Desai,President and COO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"Regarding generative AI, the demand differs by industry."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Bill McDermott,CEO,Executive,"Internal Automation, Risk/Regulatory",Yes,0.8,"So, if you just think about that for a minute, you say, well, what can generative AI do to automate document generation, for example, that would be in line with regulatory protocols and you come up with site contracting agreements, for example, that also include the patient because the patient has t"
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Gina Mastantuono,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.7,"Specifically, when you think about investments in R&D headcount, it's all around continued innovation and our investments in Gen AI and AI."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Bill McDermott,CEO,Executive,Internal Automation,No,0.8,"We actually even had with legal service delivery, AI tell us that we're spending too much time on contracts less than $250,000."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Samad Samana,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"Specifically, regarding the 200 basis points, could you break down how much of that was due to the adoption of Gen AI and the net new ACV that exceeded expectations versus the strength of the renewal cohort?"
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Gina Mastantuono,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,No,0.6,"And I would say it's driven probably half and half by net new ACV outperformance, and certainly, Gen AI is in there, but it's not all Gen AI."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Samad Samana,Analyst,Analyst,Internal Automation,No,0.4,"But as you think about the product portfolio and some of the newer products you've talked about over the last year or so beyond Gen AI's observability or ERP workflows, where are you seeing the most demand or interest outside of Gen AI?"
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,CJ Desai,President and COO,Executive,Internal Automation,No,0.8,"So, as I'm walking through this list besides Gen AI and then I can tell you the same thing about security, risk, and so our asset management had a phenomenal 2023."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Alex Zukin,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.5,The discussions around Gen AI and its tangible effects on the model and this quarter were impressive.
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Gina Mastantuono,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.6,"What I'd like to mention is that Gen AI products contributed the largest net new annual contract value in their first full quarter compared to any of our other new product families, including the original Pro SKU."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Gina Mastantuono,CFO,Executive,Uncategorized,Yes,0.7,The advancements in Gen AI and our entire product portfolio will contribute to that growth.
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,CJ Desai,President and COO,Executive,Internal Automation,Yes,0.9,"So, from an IT service management perspective, IT operations management perspective, this is not a generative AI-specific deal, but it was very much a very strategic transaction on the foundational platform for automation and digital services at this large financial services institution."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Joel Fishbein,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,"And the second question around public sector is, what do you think their AI adoption cadence is going to look like from your perspective?"
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,CJ Desai,President and COO,Executive,Vague/Buzzword,No,0.8,"And then in Q4, our Australia public sector team also did really well, and we had significant platform expansion with some of the large central governments and their agencies, including generative AI."
NOW,Systems Software,2023Q4,Joel Fishbein,Analyst,Analyst,Uncategorized,No,0.4,And just as the follow-up on the public sector adopting AI.
